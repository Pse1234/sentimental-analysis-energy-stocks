Look at how hot summers have got and how quickly. When we see this pace of change in Earth's past it usually means mass extinction. That's us. That's now. The longer this goes on, the more assured our fate becomes.

I have never seen climate carnage on the scale of the floods here in Pakistan.

As our planet continues to warm, all countries will increasingly suffer losses and damage from climate beyond their capacity to adapt.

This is a global crisis. It demands a global response.

Oil and gas companies say they’re going green. Yesterday I looked through some of their accounts to see if it’s true.

In the first half of this year, 4 companies made £74.4bn and reinvested £3.4bn in low carbon energy. On average, that’s equivalent to 5% of their profits.

Hi Martin, Recently Scottish Power suggested taxpayers borrow £100 Billion to pay their energy bills, and then pay it back over 20 years. Would it be feasible for the UK to use that £100 bn to buy BP PLC (current value £86.22 bn) and then sell the energy back into the UK cheaper?

Mine are 380w panels which could account for some of the difference. 

FYI : Go for the biggest battery you can afford. I went for 8.2kWh and it took me less than a week to realise I should have gone for more.

Why not go all out on green energy, ditch oil and gas, become a world leader and explore the possibilities?
Retrain large swathes of your staff with your astounding profits. Use your staff as consultants for other companies and countries. Show everyone else how it could be done.

Aug 13, 2022Frage an die #Öl-Konzerne:
Warum ist Heizöl auf einmal nur 20 Cent (ohne Tankrabatt also 40 Cent) günstiger als #Benzin, wenn es vor der ""#Krise"" doch locker über 60 Cent günstiger war?

Since 2016, both BP and Shell have been huge net beneficiaries of the UK tax system, having been handed a cumulative total of £727m of UK taxpayers’ money over this period.

This is despite the firms making £10s of billions in profit and paying £bns in tax in other jurisdictions.

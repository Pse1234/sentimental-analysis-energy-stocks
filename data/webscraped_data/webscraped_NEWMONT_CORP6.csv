Makes sense. 

Republicans thought giving corporations tax cuts would mean they could use them to their advantage. They got cocky. Similar to how MAGA pretend-loved cops until they started murdering them. Cops fought back.

Hopefully both are done being useful pawns for the GOP.

Most meaningful donations occur in the 12 months leading up to an election (2022 in this case).  Don't forget names on this list.  Compare it to ""donors"" in 2022.

Judd: Will you be monitoring donations to GOP candidates 1 & 2 years from now, to report on whether or not they actually hold back funding when it matters?

This is a ""dead time"" when most corps don't make donations, anyway, so this is likely just a PR stunt.

To me it's worse than just voting against impeachment. Trump's already been impeached. They voted that a Senate trial now is unconstitutional. (It's not.)

They voted against the Constitution, they voted to ignore the Constitution. It's a violation of their oath of office.

Major corporations should stop donating to all politicians. Think about it...why does any politician need a donation? Only to get re-elected and return favors.  Donations are nothing more than bribes that the politicians h e legalized for their own profit.

He’s worried about the Helium he stole from Timor-Leste and gave away to ConocoPhillips. Helium is finite and used in superconductors and there is a global shortage. Downer should be shitting in his shoes

I think we got as close tonight as we could ever expect. Downer said as much in discussing generalities, but was much more circumspect when it came to specifics. A rudimentary awareness of body-language would have pointed to the gaps. Ronni would probably also approve.

I’m not so jaded to think that this Labor government cannot do it, especially if they’re left stuck on 75 seats but also because they need senate approval too. Any deal with the Liberals & Nationals will further drive this teal independent wave but towards the Red seats next time

When federal ICAC is in place (hopefully by Christmas), it’ll prioritise cases with the potential for ongoing harm. 
It’ll be allowed to investigate whatever it wants, but I’d be shocked if there aren’t more urgent matters.
In short: don’t ask Downer anything - he’s not relevant.

These are the most serious legal issues facing Australia at the moment. With all the talk of a Federal ICAC this needs to be at the top of the list. The treatment of Witness K and Bernard Collaery is, in my mind, criminal. People need to be held to account. Including Downer.

I stand to be corrected, but I thought I read they characterised the helium as waste, when in fact, it is far more valuable than methane; and were attempting to obtain 100% of the by credits (ex CH4), by deception, for Australia and US multinationals.

Also take into account that most companies producing O&G belong to IPAA. Basically mom and pop O&G companies not the Majors like ExxonMobil, BP, ConocoPhillips, etc. Their budget for drilling a new well each year varies and is usually  based on the previous years revenue.

Carry your water/soda/juice in your hand.

Stay cold or hot depending on the weather.

Wear only cotton or hemp - but can't grow it with most fertilizers

That sounds loke a great idea! And you've had the power all along to stop doing all this shit.
